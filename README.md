CSCI STUDENTS
This is my personal documentation of my course work at Fresno State. This is not private because this also serves as part of my coding portfolio.

ALL the work that you see here in this repository was done by me. YOU do NOT have my permission to copy my code for any reasons. You are welcome to send me an e-mail if you have any questions.

If you are a student and you are reading this, be aware that copying another students work is a violation of the academic honesty code within your institution. If you reference outside material you should present clear documentation of all your sources.

Thank you. Have a great day!
